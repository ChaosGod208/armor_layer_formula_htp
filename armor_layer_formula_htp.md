Armor Layer Formula (HTP)

A universal flat-armor system designed to work with Relative Defense Formula.
Simple, scalable, and perfect for RPG / ARPG / MMO / MOBA / Shooter armor systems.


---

Concept

Armor = a post-mitigation, flat reduction layer applied after all other formulas.
It scales with DEF but stays smaller, creating a clean separation:

DEF = percentage mitigation (relative, dynamic)

Armor = final flat reduction (stable, predictable)


This fixes late-game tankiness without breaking low-tier combat.


---

Formula

Armor = Defense ÷ 15
(Clamp maximum armor ratio at Defense ÷ 10 through passives / traits / class bonuses,...)

FinalDamage = Max(0, Damage After All Mitigation − Armor)

Why Max(0, ...):
Prevent negative damage (which would heal player).
Clean cap – no infinite tank, no heal exploit.

Examples

Example 1

Monster Hit: 10,000 dmg
Player DEF: 1,500

Armor = 1,500 ÷ 15 = 100
Damage After All Mitigation: 7,000 
Final = 6,900


---

Example 2 — High DEF scaling

Monster Hit: 2,000 dmg
Player DEF: 3,000

Armor = 3,000 ÷ 15 = 200
Damage After All Mitigation: 1,200
Final = 1,000


---

Example 3 — Armor max-boost (DEF ÷ 10)

Player DEF: 2,000
Boost → Armor = 2,000 ÷ 10 = 200


---

Notes

Armor is post-formula. Applied after Relative DEF or any other mitigation system.

This cleanly buffs all classes, not only tanks.

Helps low-damage monsters stay relevant while still rewarding defense builds.

Prevents percentage defense from becoming useless at high level.

Works perfectly for:

RPG / ARPG

MMO tanking systems

Shooter ballistic armor

Strategy units

MOBAs (final damage clamp layer)

Recommended Use

Combine with Relative Defense Formula (HTP) for best progression curves:

1. Relative DEF handles dynamic percent scaling


2. Armor handles final stability & late-game survivability



This two-layer system produces extremely satisfying tank progression without power creep.
